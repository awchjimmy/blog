問：人類與 AI 想事情的方式非常不同。  
舉例來說人們可以深入調查或是將許多低風險漏洞串連成為高風險漏洞，  
AI 能夠做到這些嗎？

ChatGPT 答：
```
You're absolutely right: AI and human beings approach problem-solving differently.
While AI is powerful at processing large volumes of data quickly and recognizing patterns,
humans excel at deep dives, critical thinking, and connecting seemingly unrelated details to identify vulnerabilities.
```
ChatGPT 提到 AI 的強項是處理大量資料、發現模式；
人類的強項是深入調查、獨立思考能力、把看似毫無相關的事物串連在一起。

```
Can AI achieve the same deep dive and investigation as a human in cybersecurity?
In short, AI can assist in some aspects of the process,
but it may not fully replicate the creative, investigative, and nuanced approach that a human security expert uses when discovering vulnerabilities.
However, AI can enhance human investigation by speeding up repetitive tasks, providing insights, and detecting patterns that humans might overlook.

Here's a breakdown of how AI can help and where human skills still play an important role:

1. Identifying Individual Vulnerabilities (AI-Assisted)
AI can scan large datasets, systems, and networks much faster than a human could. It can identify individual vulnerabilities based on known patterns, signatures, and behaviors. For example, tools like Nessus or OpenVAS can automate the identification of vulnerabilities like outdated software versions or weak passwords.

How AI works:

AI models (especially supervised learning) are trained on historical data of vulnerabilities and security incidents. This allows them to automatically flag security holes based on common patterns.
Deep learning techniques can help AI identify unknown vulnerabilities by analyzing the behavior of systems and applications (often referred to as behavioral analysis).
2. AI in Detecting Exploit Chains (Somewhat Limited)
Detecting a "chain" of small, seemingly unrelated bugs that lead to a critical vulnerability is an area where AI is still evolving. AI has some potential here but needs human guidance for complex multi-step exploits.

How AI works:

Automated Penetration Testing Tools: AI can automate penetration testing to attempt multiple attacks at once, uncovering chains of vulnerabilities. For example, an AI model might find a vulnerability in one system that allows it to exploit a misconfiguration in another part of the network.
Machine Learning for Attack Path Prediction: Advanced machine learning models can simulate possible attack paths. This involves AI learning from past incidents and understanding how attackers might chain small vulnerabilities to achieve an exploit.
However, this is limited when it comes to the human-level skill of connecting seemingly unimportant or disconnected bugs across different layers or systems. AI is still not as good at identifying hidden attack vectors that humans can infer through intuition and deep system knowledge.

3. Deep Dive and Investigation
Human cybersecurity professionals excel at investigating systems from the ground up. They can:

Manually inspect logs to identify suspicious activity.
Correlate anomalies in different systems that may indicate a chain of vulnerabilities.
Think creatively about the attacker's mindset and plan out sophisticated attack chains.
Where AI struggles:

Context and Complexity: Humans can recognize subtle contextual clues (e.g., an anomaly that, by itself, doesn’t seem like a vulnerability but, when combined with others, forms a critical risk).
Adapting to New Threats: Humans can adapt quickly to entirely new kinds of threats that AI has never encountered before (e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities or new attack techniques).
AI in deep dive investigations:

Log Analysis: AI can help humans by automating log analysis and highlighting unusual patterns. For example, AI can help find strange patterns in authentication logs, unusual traffic flows, or unexpected file access, which might point to a vulnerability.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI can assist in reading and analyzing documentation, threat intelligence reports, and other textual data that could be relevant to finding vulnerabilities.
Automated Threat Intelligence: AI models can gather and analyze threat intelligence from different sources and correlate it with the network environment to identify potential attack chains.
4. Discovering Critical Bugs via Chain of Vulnerabilities
Humans often excel at discovering critical bugs because they can connect various small issues across different parts of the system. This involves:

Understanding the System as a Whole: Humans can see how different bugs in different parts of the system might chain together.
Creative Exploration: Humans can think outside the box, testing things that AI might not prioritize based on existing data patterns.
How AI could assist here:

Automated Bug Tracking: AI could be used to aggregate small vulnerabilities and track whether they appear across different parts of a system. If an AI identifies multiple bugs in different layers of the system, it could propose scenarios where they might be chained together to form a critical vulnerability.
Red Teaming with AI: AI models could simulate how an attacker might exploit multiple small vulnerabilities to escalate privilege or access. This could be a useful tool for penetration testing teams but still needs human intervention for interpretation.
5. Combining AI and Human Expertise
The best approach might be a combination of AI and human intelligence, where AI handles repetitive tasks and initial vulnerability detection, and humans step in for critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and deep investigation.

Example Workflow:

AI: Automatically scans and identifies common vulnerabilities in systems (e.g., missing patches, weak configurations).
Human: Investigates interconnected systems and identifies how small bugs might combine to create a more significant threat. This could include inspecting application logic, analyzing code for subtle bugs, or finding complex misconfigurations.
AI: Assists by providing a list of potential vulnerabilities in the network and suggesting possible exploit paths based on patterns it’s learned.
Summary
AI's Strengths: Fast, accurate identification of individual vulnerabilities, pattern recognition, and automated tasks.
Human's Strengths: Creative problem-solving, deep investigations, connecting bugs into exploit chains, adapting to new or unique threats.
AI is evolving and can certainly assist with identifying vulnerabilities and exploits, but humans still have the upper hand when it comes to critical thinking, understanding complex systems, and connecting small vulnerabilities into larger, more dangerous exploits. Combining the two—AI handling the heavy lifting of data analysis and pattern recognition, and humans applying expertise and intuition—offers the best approach for modern cybersecurity practices.
